# ChungusMake++ Basics

ChungusMake++ is a tool for generating simple Makefiles.

Please note: ChungusMake++ (as of right now) is not very advanced and the Makefiles that it generates are very simple may need some modification.

# Things to Kepp in Mind

+ ChungusMake++ will run on Windows, but the Makefiles that it generates might not work on Windows. This tool is mostly useless on Windows, since there are fancy IDEs like VS (not VSCode), still, ***The Makefiles might still work on Windows***.
